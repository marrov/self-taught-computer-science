# Self-taught Computer Science Degree:

This repository will host my journey into self-teaching myself the knowledge required to obtain an undergraduate Computer Science degree.

Here is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that I will be following to satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree. The original repository from which mine has been based can be found [here](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) and has been tweaked to my specific background and interests.

## C++

Prerequisites: all Programming and Theory courses

Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that there are very many very bad C++ books out there. The following is a small list of key books extracted from [the Definitive C++ Book Guide and List](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list):

- Introduction with programming experience: [A Tour of C++, 2nd Ed.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134997832)
- Best practices: [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491903996)
