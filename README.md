# Self-taught Computer Science Degree

This repository will host my journey into self-teaching myself a computer science degree.

The following is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that I will be following to satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate computer science degree. This repository has been based on others' work, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs), [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), and [here](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). Additionally, this roadmap to computer science has been tweaked to my specific background and interests. For instance, all mathematics courses (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, etc) have not been included as they have been already covered by my previous studies (i.e. B.Sc. and M.Sc. in aerospace engineering).

## C++

Prerequisites: CSB1, PC1-PC6, PO1-PO3 and T1-T3.

Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that there are very many very bad C++ books out there. The following is a small list of key books extracted from [the Definitive C++ Book Guide and List](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list):

- Introduction with programming experience: [A Tour of C++, 2nd Ed.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134997832)
- Best practices: [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491903996)
